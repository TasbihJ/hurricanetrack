Hurricane Irma Tracker 

This tracker is designed to track the path the 2017 Hurricane Irma took outside the Gulf of Mexico, and near the Carribean Islands. The project iterates over a set of data and maps the category level the hurricane was at each given coordinates. 

Each category is illustrated by color: Category 1- White, Category 2- Green, Category 3- Yellow, Category 4- Orange, and Category 5- Red.
